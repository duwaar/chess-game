A to-do list of tasks for the python chess game.

Known Bugs:

Necessary:
 -Use the Chess.board array to hold more data than just names of pieces.
     -piece names
     -dimensions of each square
     -selections
 -Implement graphics (probably with pyglet).
    Of course, this is the point of the project, but it sure has taken a long time to get here. At
    this point, the list of necessary graphics is something like,
     -pieces
     -mouseover and click highlights
 -Implement graphical input.
    Split the "update" method into different methods for each input type/condition.

Optional:
 -Add a border around the game window
 -Create a state class
 -Network game (human to human)
 -Additional rules
     -Pawn promotion
     -Castling
     -Stalemate
 -AI players
    Don't do this from scratch--use a free, open-source, chess engine, like stockfish.
